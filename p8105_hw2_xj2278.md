# Problem 1

Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         range = "A2:N408", 
                         1) %>% 
  na.omit("Dumpster") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(as.numeric(sports_balls)))
```

Reading and cleaning the precipitation data for 2018.

``` r
precipitation_2018 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         range = "A2:B14", 
                         5) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_2019 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         range = "A2:B8", 
                         4) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2019")

precipitation =
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2019?

The trash wheel dataset has 344 observations, and key variables are
dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered. The median number
of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 8

The precipitation dataset has 18 observations, and key variables are
month, total, year. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33.

# Problem 2

Reading the pols-month dataset.
